# Simple Console RPG
This is a simple console rpg made to learn Java polymorphism basics. To play, simply type the letters corresponding to the option displayed.

For example when asked to choose character class "S - Swordsman" "M - Mage", type S or s to choose Swordsman and M or m to choose Mage.

The goal is to reach the exit to travel from level to level and win by reaching level 4's exit.

Tip: Try to farm monsters to buy better gear before going to a higher level

The game relies heavily on ASCII art.

There is room to improvement in game balance and features. Also, there are probably unforeseen bugs.
